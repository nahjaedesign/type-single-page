# Variable Type Specimen Website
A month-long project working with HTML, CSS, CSS grid, and Figma to create a visually dynamic and engaging type specimen website for the variable font 'Roslindale'. After researching the font and its designer, David Jonathan Ross, I was inspired by its vintage flair and similarities to retro book covers and advertisments from the 70s. Using Figma, I created blob-like shapes to mimic the blobs inside a lava lamp and used the font's glyphs to create a patterned background that mimics retro wallpaper, further tying into the 70's aesthetic. The website dives into a brief history of the font, it's languaes, full character set, glyphs, and its variations. I've intentionally animated each section to further emphasize the font's capabiliies and overall ambience. It was very important to me that these animations operated slow and gently, to further convey the <em>groovy</em> mood of this font.
